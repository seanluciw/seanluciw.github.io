      <h3 id="headline">A brief list of Frank Zappa's notable attributes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>His <strong>eyebrows</strong> were huge; in fact he would tell his musician employees to "put the eyebrows on it" which meant to bring the musical performance to the next level.</li>
        <li>His <strong>guitar style </strong>  was innovative and fun, which you can hear on the instrumental triple-album "Shut Up 'n' Play Yer Guitar."</li>
        <li>His compositions were complex, his lyrics satirical, and his diversity extensive. He was hilariously quotable and wisely regarded as a <strong>genius</strong>.</li>
        <li>Aside from cigarettes and coffee, he was <strong>drug-free</strong>.</li>
        <li>He hired <strong>Steve Vai</strong>.</li>
        <li>He had very <strong>high standards</strong> and was a relentless band leader.</li>
        <li>He was a strong voice for <strong>freedom of speech</strong> during the 1985 PMRC hearings.</li>
        <li>He was born on <strong>Winter Solstice</strong>.</li>
        <li>In 1963 he <strong>played a bicycle</strong> on the Steve Allen Show on TV.
        <li>He did things <strong>his way</strong> and people believed in him.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom, your dad, your teacher, your priest, or some guy on television telling you how to do your shit, then you deserve it."</p>
