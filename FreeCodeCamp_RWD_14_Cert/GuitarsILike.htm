          <p>This is a list of some of my favourite guitar designs (some of which I own) and some ponderances about them.
          </p>
        <p>Observe the following piece of code:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>print('BTW, expect to see some code because it's part of the assignment!')</code>
          </pre>

        <article>
          <p>Strats are elegant and curvy, like a beautiful woman or a jade plant. They deliver a range of distinctive sonic textures from grainy to glassy to smooth, thanks to the single-coil pickups which can also be combined "out-of-phase" for a unique clarity. Humbuckers can also be used, which brings up the idea of the Super-Strat, especially if you include a Floyd Rose, like my black-and-silver RG or my old Heartfield with the Clockwork Orange sticker.
          </p>
          <p>Observe the following piece of code:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>msg1 = "famous Stratocaster examples include:"
              msg2 = "Jimi, Stevie Ray, Sultans of Swing, Comfortably Numb"
              print(msg1 + msg2)</code>
          </pre>

          <p>SG's look cool because the double cutaway reminds me of Devil horns or the Batman logo. Angus Young plays one! I always thought they felt awkward to play until I had a change of heart one day and had to have one. The upper register above the 12th fret is very user-friendly.
          </p>
          <p>Observe the following piece of code:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>msg3 = "Have AC/DC done any Batman songs?"
              if(True):
              &nbsp &nbsp print(msg3)
              &nbsp &nbsp print('No.')
              &nbsp &nbsp break</code>

          <p>One day I saw this nice looking guitar and the paint color combined with the smooth body reminded me of red Chiclets gum. I found the perfect strap for it, which was the colour of Thrills gum. Even the neck has an elegant golden honey colour. Her name is Chiclet. Over the years it has proven to be my most comfortable electric; if I ever manage to record a first-take keeper, it's usually on this guitar.

          <p>Yamaha also make motorbikes, in case fretted shredness is not enough. My first electric guitar was an SE-250, which was Strat-shaped in pearlescent white (purple and green highlights). I remember the first horrified dent I put in that guitar, with a metal pick. This was only the beginning of much metal mayhem, as thrashing mosh pits could attest. It is still beautifully stickerbombed, and I recently had the frets replaced!
          </p>
          <p>Here's a partial list of the stickers on the SE-250:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Sadistic Humor logo sticker
            </li>
            <li>
              Too Dark Park sticker
            </li>
            <li>
              Garbage Pail Kids sticker
            </li>
            <li>
              Disciples of Power sticker
            </li>
            <li>
              a Pog showing Luke Skywalker being arrested by Stormtroopers
            </li>

          <p>Once upon a time I tried an Explorer at the music store, and it was a memorable experience to say the least. The wide flatness of the body, combined with the military gray paint job, made me feel like I was skating across an aircraft carrier. I reminisce about that sometimes.
          </p>
          <p>Observe the following piece of code:</p>
          <code>print("A guitar is not a military vehicle")</code>
